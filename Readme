# File Writing Example in Java

This Java program demonstrates how to write text to a file using `BufferedWriter` and `FileWriter`. It appends the string `"Java files are easy"` to a file named `newfile.txt`. If the file doesn't exist, it creates one. The program also includes exception handling for any file-related errors.

## Features
- Appends text to `newfile.txt` or creates the file if it doesn't exist.
- Uses `BufferedWriter` for efficient file writing.
- Handles file-related errors with a `try-catch` block.
